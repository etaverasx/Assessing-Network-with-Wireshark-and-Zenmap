# Assessing-Network-with-Wireshark-and-Zenmap
This project is a detailed account of my first steps into the wild world of network analysis. Using Wireshark to snoop on data packets and Zenmap to discover what's hiding on the network, I've got a lot to show. It turns out, network traffic is way more exciting than watching paint dry (maybe). Seriously. All the lab deliverables are below.

## Cybersecurity and Network Analysis Tools: ##

- Wireshark: A tool to capture and analyze network traffic.
- Zenmap: The graphical interface for Nmap, used to map networks and find open ports.
- Nmap: A command-line tool for network discovery and security scanning.
- TCPDUMP: A command-line packet analyzer for Linux.

## Command-Line Utilities: ##

- ipconfig: Displays network configuration on Windows.
- ifconfig: Displays network configuration on Linux.
- ARP: A protocol to find a device's MAC address from its IP address.
- Ping: Tests the connectivity of a host.
- Hping3: Generates and analyzing TCP/IP packets.
